        <h2>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”)</h2>
        <p>The DMCA provides recourse to those who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by us infringe your copyright, you may send us a notice to hello@womenandcolor.com requesting that we remove the material or block access to it.</p>
        <p>Your DMCA notice must include the following information:</p>
        <p>(a) Physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Services; (d) The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the complaining party; (e) A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner or the law; and (f) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and is given under penalty of perjury, and that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
        <p>If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices under the DMCA, as well as all other communications addressed to us relating to these Terms of Use, should be sent by e-mail to hello@womenandcolor.com.</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Please be aware that penalties may apply for false claims under DMCA under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f). If you are unaware whether the material you are reporting is considered infringement, please contact an attorney.</p>

Women and Color expressly disclaims any liability that may arise between users of the Services or users and any third party.</p>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p>
